# Installation

After you purchase the asset from the Unity Asset Store, it will appear in the [package manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui.html). You can access the package manager from *Window > Package Manager*. Once the window is open, make sure you are viewing *Packages: My Assets* as the Localization Asset will be listed there. Select Localization Asset and click the *Import* button located at the bottom right corner.
